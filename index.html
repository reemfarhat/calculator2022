        <p>Believers Bail Out is an abolitionist collective that provides bail out service to Muslims in pretrial incarceration and ICE. It was founded in 2018 and the organization's main presence is based in the Chicago area, but BBO has a national presence through webinars and their partnerships with other organizations.</p>

        <p>According to Hirah Khatri, BBO’s member coordinator, BBO’s main mission is not reform but abolition.</p>

        <p>Khatri said, “Our goal is to raise awareness about the structure that is designed supposedly to improve safety and security of individuals but rather is actually the opposite and is perpetuating harm among marginalized communities including black queer but some communities as well.”</p>

        <p>Nabiha Maqbool, a founding BBO member, said that abolition is not about an absence but a presence. She believes that instead of investing in structures such as prisons and borders, investments should be made in systems that promote safety and security such as community food and housing for individuals.</p>

        <p>“When we talk about abolition we are saying that we want to live in a world where people have what they need to have to actually be truly safe,” Maqbool said.</p>

        <p>What makes BBO distinct is their Zakat bail bond system. Zakat is an annual tax wealth that all Muslims must pay yearly for charitable purposes. It is a form of redestribution of wealth to those in need and is part of the Islamic belief that all wealth belongs to God and not individuals. According to Khatri, people are often surprised to know that bail bonds fall under Zakat. However, the criteria for Zakat includes people who are poor, in debt, or in bondage.</p>

        <p>BBO urges it’s members to donate their zakat to their bond fund. Through raising community funds, BBO has been able to free over 30 incarcerated Muslims and have raised over $250,000.</p>

        <p>Aside from their bail out system, BBO also offers pen pal programs to correspond with incarcerated Muslims, visitation programs to visit Chicago County Jail, the largest single-site jail in the United States, and post bail out support for formerly incarcerated individuals.</p>

        <p>As the member coordinator, Khatri organizes these prison visitations to provide emotional support for incarcerated individuals who are on bond but have not been given a specific amount for bond and therefore BBO is unable to bail them out.</p>

        <p>These visits occur weekly and usually include about 5-6 volunteers. The visits also serve to educate volunteers on the incarceration system in the United States. During visits, Khatri shared that many volunteers ask questions about incarceration and become more curious about the system as a whole.</p>

        <p>According to Khatri, these visits are often powerful and emotional experiences.</p>

        <p>“I remember hearing a story from one woman who was so surprised that someone had come visit her. She said you are the first group of people I have seen in almost a year,” she said. “Every person who has done a visit has left it feeling shook. It is a very powerful experience for those who have the opportunity to do a visit.”</p>

        <p>According to Khatri, COVID-19 has made these visitations a bit more difficult due to various restrictions and regulations.</p>

        <p>BBO also provides post bailout support. This support can consist of anything from social services for mental health, weekly check ins, reminders about court dates, or even buying groceries.</p>

        <p>While their services are a main part of their work, BBO’s main priority is creating long lasting change.</p>

        <p>“We recognize that everyone will not get free just by paying their ransoms over and over. What we want to do is harm reduction which is to reduce the harm that incarceration has on individuals and families,” Maqbool said.</p>

        <p>“The goal is not just to get one individual out but to highlight to all of us that these aren't carceral systems being deployed and our names for ‘safety’ and it does not actually make us safe. People living in poor neighborhoods are more likely to be targeted by police, arrested, and placed in pre-trial incarceration yet not having the opportunity to prove their innocence in court. So they are being incarcerated for no other reason except for that they are poor. No one should have to be sitting in a cage just because they can't pay their ransom. BBO wants to see the eradication of this system everywhere.”</p>
